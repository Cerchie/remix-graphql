# jokes-tutorial

This example is functionally equivalent to the app you build in the official
[jokes tutorial](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/jokes) from Remix, but
its actions and loaders have been rewritten using `remix-graphql` and the app
contains a GraphQL API that handles both authentication and loading, creating
or deleting jokes.
